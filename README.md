I built this models/methods from scratch mostly using numpy and sometimes pytorch to clearly understand how everything works. Though the implementations are often guided by existing resources such as books and courses, I painstakingly introduced clarity, readability and clean code.

I have another repository for **more NLP oriented tasks [here](https://github.com/adhocmaster/nlp-practice).** But all the advanced modeling are in this repository.


## Transformers
1. [Self-Attention with Numpy](./transformers/self-attention.ipynb)
2. [GPT with Pytorch, sklearn, and numpy on Wine Reviews](./transformers/GDL-gpt.ipynb)


## Coursera Deep Learning with Pytorch
[Here are my solutions](./deep-learning-v2-pytorch-master/). They are often different from the instructor's implementation for clarity and updated libraries. 

## Mastering OpenCV
[Here are my solutions](./mastering-opencv/). They are often different from the instructor's implementation for clarity and updated libraries.
